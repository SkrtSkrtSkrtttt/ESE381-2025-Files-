# Embedded Microprocessor Systems Labs

This repository contains lab files and project implementations from a hands-on embedded systems course focused on AVR microcontroller development. The course walks through the full embedded system design cycle — from requirements specification to real-time prototyping and final system integration.

## 📚 Topics Covered

- Real-time system requirements and timing analysis  
- Interrupt-driven architecture (Timers, External Interrupts, ADC, etc.)  
- Analog-to-digital conversion (ADC) and digital output control  
- Multi-module system design and modular C structure  
- Interfacing high-level C with low-level AVR assembly  
- Debugging using breakpoints, register inspection, and logic analyzers  
- Serial communication (USART, I2C, SPI)  
- Bit masking, and state machines
